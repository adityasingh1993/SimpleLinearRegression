# SimpleLinearRegression

Linear Regression is based on the equation Y=AX+B

Mathematically we can say
where A is the slope, B is the  intercept, Y is dependent variable and X is independent.

But in Machine Learning we can say
Y is output variable and directly dependent on X
and A is the linear regression line which seperate the data and B is the noise or error term.

In SimpleLinearRegression, we have two variable Years of Experience(X) and Salary(Y)
Salary is dependent on Years of Experience.

So to build our linear regression model we will import the LinearRegression class from Scikit Learn.
We will take the object of LinearRegression and provide the training data X_train and Y_train, on which model will get train.
After training the model, we can run or test data X_test and compare prdicted data with the Y_test.
